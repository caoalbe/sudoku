### Running The Game
This is my first project on here.  I hope you enojoy it.

Run the PlaySudoku.py file

You will be presented with a pre-generated Sudoku Board.

Play the game by filling in the blank entry spaces and click check answers to see if you've solved the game.

Press solution for the program to generate the solved state of the game with a backtracking algorithm.

### Short Falls
Alot of features that I originally envisioned had to be scrapped in the interest of time.  Originally I wanted to show the intermediary
steps of each backtrack when solving the game.  But this was my first handle on using Tkinter for the GUI.

I also wanted to create an executible file to distribute easily.  However I ran into problems with pyinstaller now being able to recognize
my modules that I could not figure out how to fix.

### What I've learned
This was a great learning experience trying to grasp new packages tools very quickly.
